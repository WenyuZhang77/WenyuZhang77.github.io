This is Wenyu Zhang's awesome website

# I made it!
This is Wenyu's first website. Nice job. 

I am a first-year master student in biostatistics at Columbia Univerisity Mailman School of public health.

I am a big fan of Formula one racing, and Kimi Räikkönen is my favorite F1 racing driver.

# Data analysis - NY NOAA
NOAA of the NCEI provides public access to some weather data, including the GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network)-Daily database of summary statistics from weather stations around the world.

In this section, I am trying to analysis the data in "NY NOAA" by creating a flexdashboard.

You can check the flexdashboard for [dashboard](DASHBOARD.html)

If you are interested in the process, feel free to check [plotly](plotly.html)
